Gocal
=====

Gocal is a simple clone of pcal. It's a tool to create monthly calendars in PDF with a no-nonsense attitude.
Right now it creates a 12 page PDF with one month per page. Pcal has quite a few options, that gocal will
never support, like calculating Easter. On the other hand, adding events to days shall be added soon.

Features:

* PDF generation
* Week number on every Monday
* Sunrise/Sunset for every Sunday
* No other languages than English currently
* No other 'first day of the week' than Monday
* No adding of events to days yet.

Why not using PCal? Postscript is obsolete.


The main idea of gocal is that you print one or more month and use it to add 
handwritten notes to it.
