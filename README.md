Gocal
=====

Gocal is a simple clone of pcal. It's a standalone tool and a library to create monthly calendars in PDF 
with a no-nonsense attitude. By default it creates a 12-page PDF with one month per page for the current year. 
To avoid confusion, the library is called gocal, while the standalone tool is named gocalendar.

Alternatively the following arguments are supported:

  gocalendar YEAR => Create a 12-page calendar for YEAR, e.g. 2014

  gocalendar MONTH YEAR => Create a 1-page calendar for the MONTH in YEAR, e.g. 5 2014

  gocalendar BEGIN-MONTH END-MONTH YEAR => Create a sequence from BEGIN-MONTH to END-MONTH in YEAR, e.g. 5 7 2014


Features
========

* PDF generation
* Week number on every Monday
* Day of year 
* Moon phases
* Events in XML configuration file
* Several languages 
* Wallpaper option
* Photo calendar option (from single image or directory)
* Page orientation and paper size option
* Font selection

Why not using pcal? There are several reasons. One, I couldn't build it on 
Windows, next, I don't care about Postscript, third, a calendar seems to 
be exactly a kind of project that I am able to handle from a complexity perspective 
as a single developer. And pcal doesn't do UTF-8.

The main idea of gocal is simplicity. While it is absolutely possible to create
an application where every single stroke is configurable, I believe that most of
you are too busy to play around with lots of options and want a pleasant calendar
out-of-the-box. That's what gocal provides.

The power of gocal is based on the cool libraries that it includes. This implies that
several of the options are actually options of the libraries, e.g. the paper format (gofpdf) or
the supported languages (goodsign/monday).

It is suggested to hide some of the optional fields or the cells will look crowded.


Build instructions
==================

Run 

	go get github.com/StefanSchroeder/gocal

Gocal has a quite a few dependencies that go should resolve automatically.

To build the standalone tool, change into the gocalendar directory and run

	go build 

You create a bunch of sample files (and in passing test gocal) by running

   	go test

License
=======

The BSD type license is in the LICENSE file.

For the API documentation of gocal the library visit the 
auto-generated docs on godoc.org.

Options of gocalendar
=====================

### Help

		-h  Help: Summarizes the options.

### Footer

		-f="Gocal": Footer note

Change the string at the bottom of the page. To disable the footer, simply set it to the
empty string. There is a small deficiency, that the footer text is not centered, but starts
in the middle of the page.

### Font

		-font="": font

		-font serif    (Times lookalike)
		-font mono     (Courier lookalike)
		-font sans     (Arial lookalike)
		-font path/to/font.ttf    (your favorite font)

Set the font. Only truetype fonts are supported. Look into c:\Windows\Fonts on Windows
and /usr/share/fonts to see what fonts you have. Gocal comes with three fonts built-in:
The Gnu FreeMonoBold, FreeSerifBold and FreeSansBold. They look pretty similar to 
(in that order) Courier, Times and Arial and should meet all your standard font needs.
These fonts are licensed under the Gnu FreeFont License which accompanies this README.txt.
Read more about them at https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont. To use fonts gocal, 
auxiliary files are created in a temporary directory.

In addition you can provide your own TTF on the commandline if you prefer something fancy.

### Font size

Font sizes relative to the default size can be set with 

    -fontscale floatingpoint number

The default is 1.0 and typically you shouldn't change the font size. There is a 
shortcut to reduce the fontsizes globally to 75% of the default size to gain more room for 
manual notes.

    -small


### Language

		-lang="": Language

Gocal reads the LANG environment variable. If it matches one of 

		en_US en_GB nl_BE nl_NL fi_FI fr_FR fr_CA de_DE

the library goodsign/monday is used to translate the weekday names and month names.
Although this library supports a few other languages, I found that many of the 
languages do not work with the fonts I tried. The language from the environment can be 
overridden with this parameter. If your LANG is not recognized, we default to en_US.

### Hiding stuff

		-nodoy: Hide day of year

		-noevents: Hide events from config file

Gocal adds events from an XML file in the current directory to dates. This option
disables this feature.

		-nomoon: Hide moon phases

		-noweek: Hide week number

The week number according to ISO-8601 is added on every Monday by default.

		-noother: Hide neighbormonth days

This option hides the leading and trailing days of the neighbor month.
By default these days are printed in light grey.

		-plain This will hide everything that can be hidden (but not neighbormonth days).

### Output

		-o="output.pdf": Output filename

### Paper orientation

		-p="L": Orientation (L)andscape/(P)ortrait

Typically you want landscape for calendars without image and portrait for calendars with image.

### Paper format

		-paper="A4": Paper format (A3 A4 A5 Letter Legal)

### Photo / Photos / Wallpaper

		-photo=filename: Show single photo (single image in PNG JPG GIF)

This option will add this image to every month.
The filename can be a URL, and must start with http:// and must have a valid image extension.

		-photos=directory: Show multiple photos (directory with PNG JPG GIF)

e.g. gocal -photos images/

This option will add the twelve first files as images to the twelve month.
If less than twelve files are found, the sequence will re-start after the last image.
This will not work if there are non-image files in the directory (among the first twelve).
The directory option does NOT support URLs.

		-wall=filename: Show wallpaper PNG JPG GIF

e.g. gocal -wall gopher.png

This option will add this image to every month as a background. You should only 
use images with a bright tone so that you do not obstruct the usefulness of the calendar.
The filename can be a URL, and must start with http:// and must have a valid image extension.


### Maintenance

    -noclear

By default the temporary directory where fonts and the codepage are stored is deleted
at the end. This option let's you keep it. If you don't know what that means you don't care.


Event File
==================

Choosing a format for the configuration file was tough.
You might think that XML is overkill and JSON or CSV or one
of the many configuration file libraries would have been 
more adequate. Perhaps you are right. The advantage of the
XML package is, that I knew how to use it and also, the 
extensibility should I ever choose to allow more complex
configuration. The defaultname is gocal.xml.

		<Gocal>
		<Gocaldate date="12/24" text="Heilig Abend" />
		<Gocaldate date="12/25" text="Weihnachten" />
		<Gocaldate date="1/6"  text="Allerheiligen" />
		<Gocaldate date="4/19" text="Geburtstag\nGrÃ¼ndung der BRD" />
		<Gocaldate date="4/18" text="\nBirgit" />
		<Gocaldate date="9/17" text="Tomke" />
		<Gocaldate date="1/13" text="Enno" />
		<Gocaldate date="2/2" text="Otto" image="golang-gopher.png" />
		<Gocaldate date="3/3" text="Winfried" />
		<Gocaldate date="4/4" text="Selma" />
		<Gocaldate date="5/5" text="Theodor" />
		<Gocaldate date="6/6" text="Aelfred" />
		<Gocaldate date="*/20" text="Miete" />
		</Gocal>


This is a sample of the configuration file for gocal. It has all the supported
features. date is in MONTH/DAY format. The text may contain a literal \n
newline.  For the month a * is permitted and it obviously means 'every month'.
You can use a leading newline symbol to make the text wrap to the next line in
case of overlap. THe optional image tag will put an image into the cell.

I was considering to allow to configure all the options from the command line
also as parameters in the XML, but I think it's not really that important.

Roadmap
=======

* It would be really cool to allow gocal to be a drop-in replacement for pcal,
but the configuration file for pcal is really complex (=pcal allows complicated
things, like "every second Thursday after the third moon in leap years")
* I have no plans to put multiple month on a single page (yearly calendar). If
you need that, create a 12-page calendar and use the plethora of pdf-tools
to rearrange the PDF that gocal produced. E.g. pdf2ps, psbook, psnup, pdftk, etc. 
* some nice origami dodecahedron
* pocketmod?
* Allow setting of colors?

Known bugs
==========

* The event file must be encoded in UTF-8.
* When you have multiple events on the same date, they are overlapping. I
  don't intend to fix that.
* Not all text will fit into the cells with some settings, because the font size is
  not adapted dynamically to the paper format. It's a feature, not a bug.
* When using the A5 paper size, the last row of a page wraps to the next page.
* Some warnings in libraries might irritate the user.
* The dates and months are not validated. Nothing prevents you from trying to 
  generate a calendar for "13 2014", which will panic.



Acknowledgments
================

I'd like to thank the developers who wrote the great libraries that **gocal** is 
relying on, esp. Sonia Keys and Kurt Jung.
